                    have a dream . And here I am in the journey of fulfilling my dream

                    I have a dream of being a full time developer, but as currently I am a student I am learning how to
                    develope beside my studying. It is really hard for me to manage time. Still i am doing my best for
                    fulfilling one of my dreams.

                <p>
                    My journey is not a easy one. Of course no journey is easy for a first timer. Still I don't lose
                    hope, going forward towards my dreams keeps me staying energetic. Also my friends are really
                    supportive.
